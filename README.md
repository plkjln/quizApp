# Prerequisites

- NodeJS - Download and Install Node.js. You can find free NodeJS tutorials at nodeschool.io to get you started.
- MongoDB - Download and Install MongoDB - Make sure it's running on the default port (27017).

# Additional Packages

# Quick Install

The quickest way to get started is to clone the project and utilize it like this:

1. Install dependencies from root folder using your command line:
```
npm install
```
2. Run mongod and mongo: In your project directory, create a sub-directory called "data" with the following command:
```
mkdir data
```
Launch MongoDB on Windows:
```
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin" > mongod--dbpath [wherever you put your data folder]
```
So mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017 server is up and running.
3. After installation is finished use:
```
npm start
```
4. Then open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
